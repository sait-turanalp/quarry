# Lua Parser Symbol Extraction Coverage Report

*Generated: 2026-08-05 21:26:24 UTC*

## Summary
- Key nodes: 21/21 (100%)
- Symbol kinds extracted: 6

> **Note:** Key nodes are symbol-producing constructs (functions, tables, imports).

## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: Node type is recognized and handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: Node type exists in the grammar but not handled by parser (needs implementation)
- ❌ **not found**: Node type not present in the example file (may need better examples)

## Recommended Actions

✨ **Excellent coverage!** All key nodes are implemented.
