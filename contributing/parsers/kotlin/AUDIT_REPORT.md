*Generated: 2026-02-06 23:55:56 UTC*

## Summary
- Key nodes: 17/17 (100%)
- Symbol kinds extracted: 8

> **Note:** Key nodes are symbol-producing constructs (classes, functions, imports).

| annotation | 304 | ✅ implemented |
| modifiers | 289 | ✅ implemented |
| infix_expression | 234 | ✅ implemented |

## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: node type is handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: node exists in grammar but parser does not currently extract it
- ⭕ **not found**: node isn't present in the audited sample; add fixtures to verify

## Recommended Actions

All tracked nodes are currently implemented ✅
